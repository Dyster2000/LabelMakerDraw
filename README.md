# LabelMakerDrawBluetooth

The arduino directory is the Arduino code for the HackPack Label Maker that has been changed to draw what the app sends it via Bluetooth. This requires an Arduino ESP32 nano chip.

The LabelMakerDrawBluetooth is a .net Maui app that is functional on an Android. Since it is Maui, it could be made to work on an iPhone as well. It just needs the iPhone specific bluetooth code added.
